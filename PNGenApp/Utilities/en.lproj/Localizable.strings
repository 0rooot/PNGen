"LearnView.Wifi.PublicWiFi.Risk" = "The biggest risk of public wifi is that hackers can be on the same WiFi and thus connect directly to your device. They could get between you and your website or app and, on a poorly secured website, read all the data you send or receive. This is called \"man-in-the-middle\" . Hackers could even set up fake websites on the WLAN and trick you into giving your data directly to the hackers.";
"LearnView.Wifi.PublicWiFi.Tipp1" = "Make sure you have an encrypted connection between you and the website or server. A VPN (Virtual Private Networks) connection can encrypt your entire connection. This way, a hacker on the same WLAN can no longer grab data.";
"LearnView.Wifi.PublicWiFi.Tipp2" = "Hackers can always get username and password if they want to. That's why it's recommended to turn on 2FA (two factor authentication) on all services if possible. This way, the hacker will not only need your password, but also your sim card to log into your accounts.";
"LearnView.Wifi.PublicWiFi.Tipp3" = "Always keep your devices up to date and install the latest updates. Often this will also keep security up to date.";
"LearnView.Wifi.PublicWiFi.Tipp4" = "If you don't have a VPN and the website doesn't offer 2FA, you can also look at using HTTPS (small lock in the browser). This encrypts the connection of this web page and thus the data can no longer be read on the network.";
"LearnView.Wifi.PublicWiFi.Tipp5" = "Completely avoiding public WLANs makes the risk disappear altogether. Using the hotspot via the mobile network already increases the security significantly.";

"LearnView.Bluetooth.Title" = "Bluetooth Security";
"LearnView.Bluetooth.Body" = "Many know Bluetooth as a connection type from hands-free car calls, wireless music streaming and IoT devices. What sounds harmless can also provide a target for attackers. This chapter addresses the risks of Bluetooth and presents tips for preventing them.";
"LearnView.Bluetooth.Risk" = "In most cases, pairing must occur before data can be shared over a Bluetooth connection. However, a Bluetooth connection carries significant risks. For example, there is no user authentication. In addition, there are still connections that do not provide a \"man-in-the-middle\" apron. apron. So the data is transmitted very transparently.";
"LearnView.Bluetooth.Tipp1" = "Turn Bluetooth off or at least to \"Undiscoverable\" as long as you don't need it. This way your device is closed to new connections and can't pass data unintentionally.";

"LearnView.GSM.Risk" = "IMSI are the numbers that identify the SIM cards in the mobile network. With so-called IMSI catchers, attackers can catch these numbers in between and also make a \"man-in-the-middle attack\". Today, an IMSI catcher can even be used to determine the location of a smartphone or disconnect the smartphone from the network. But how can you protect yourself against an IMSI catcher?";
"LearnView.GSM.Tipp1" = "IMSI catchers connect to your phone if they can provide the smartphone with better reception quality than the provider's antennas. However, they often don't have the same throughput. So if you notice that you have full reception but very poor bandwidth, it could be an IMSI catcher. You can then put your smartphone on flight mode for a short time.";
"LearnView.GSM.Tipp2" = "The new 5G technology includes more encryption technology and security features. IMSI catchers often try to downgrade the cellular standard to 3G. You can change the setting on your smartphone under \"Settings\" > \"Mobile network\" > \"Data options\" to \"5G on\". This will make your smartphone use 5G whenever it is available.";
"LearnView.GSM.Tipp3" = "IMSI catchers are often used in places with many people. Airports or train stations are predestined for this. Just turn your smartphone off or to flight mode if you don't want to take the risk in these places.";

"LearnView.Settings.Title" = "Security settings";

Insurance companies, banks and other companies offer apps that can access and modify personal data. Emails, photos and passwords are also stored on the smartphone. With a few settings, the risk of loss or unintentional disclosure of this data can be minimized.";
"LearnView.Settings.Tipp1" = "Keep your iPhone up-to-date! Install the latest updates to the operating system. If Apple knows about a vulnerability, they usually close it directly with an update. From old operating system versions there are often already attack instructions on the Internet.";
"LearnView.Settings.Tipp2" = "Use a passcode! It is a lucky strike for an attacker if no passcode has to be entered. If you lose your smartphone, your data is directly accessible. With a passcode you prevent unwanted access. By the way: Six-digit passcodes are 100 times more secure than four-digit ones! TouchID and FaceID only increase convenience, not security!";
"LearnView.Settings.Tipp3" = "Turn on the \"USB Restricted Mode\"! Under \"Settings\" > \"Face ID & Passcode\" > \"USB accessories are not allowed on the lock screen\" you can prevent a wired connection from downloading data from your smartphone or malware to your smartphone without consent.";
"LearnView.Settings.Tipp4" = "Read the app permission requests! If apps want to access data, you must agree to it. (Google Maps wants to access your location.) Question these accesses critically. If a calculator app wants to access your photos or location, you should decline.";
