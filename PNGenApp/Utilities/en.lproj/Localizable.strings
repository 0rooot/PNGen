"LearnView.Wifi.PublicWiFi.Tipp2" = "Hackers can always get username and password if they want to. That's why it's recommended to turn on 2FA (two factor authentication) on all services if possible.

"LearnView.Wifi.PublicWiFi.Tipp4" = "If you don't have a VPN and the website doesn't offer 2FA, you can also look at using HTTPS (small lock in the browser). This encrypts the connection of this web page and thus the data can no longer be read on the network.";
"LearnView.Wifi.PublicWiFi.Tipp5" = "Completely avoiding public WLANs makes the risk disappear altogether. Using the hotspot via the mobile network already increases the security significantly.";
